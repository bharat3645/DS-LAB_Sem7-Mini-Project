## 📸 How to Add Screenshots

To display screenshots in the README:

1. **Run the Streamlit application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app2.py
   ```

2. **Take screenshots** of:
   - Dashboard overview (home page)
   - Analytics page with charts
   - Machine learning models section
   - Any other interesting features

3. **Save screenshots** in this directory with these names:
   - `dashboard.png` - Main dashboard view
   - `analytics.png` - Analytics/EDA page
   - `ml-models.png` - ML models section

4. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add screenshots/
   git commit -m "Add application screenshots"
   git push
   ```

The README will automatically display the screenshots once they're uploaded to GitHub.
